PACKAGE

1.  Make sure the package works before distributing it to the world. To test 
the package qua package, you have to build the package file and test it.  A 
common problem is forgetting to add new files to the manifest.  Use the disttest 
command to run the tests on a fresh distribution.  

cvs update
perl Makefile.PL
make disttest

2.  Once you are sure that the package works, change the master version number 
in lib/Bio/NEXUS.pm (grep on VERSION).  This will change the dist name when 
the package is built (but the cvs version has to be changed separately-- see #4). 

The initial version was based on the percent completion of NEXUS commands, 
starting with 0.66 on 8/22/06.  Subsequently we just incremented the minor number 
by 1 each time.  If you don't change this, you won't get a new version number to 
upload to CPAN. 

3.  Check everything into CVS so that you can tag the current versions.  If you 
just changed the master version number in lib/Bio/NEXUS.pm, then check that in.  

4. Tag your outgoing distribution with the master number: 

cvs tag release_xx_xx

where xx_xx is something like 0_66 etc.  

5.  Build the package 

perl Makefile.PL
make dist

6.   upload the package on CPAN.
